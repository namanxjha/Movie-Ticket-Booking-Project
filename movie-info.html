        BHEDIYA is the story of a man who turns into a wolf. Bhaskar (Varun
        Dhawan), based in Delhi, works for Bagga (Saurabh Shukla). The former is
        a road contractor and for his job, he is supposed to go to Ziro,
        Arunachal Pradesh, to construct a road through the jungle. Bhaskar
        reaches Ziro along with his cousin, Janardan (Abhishek Banerjee). Here,
        they are joined by a localite, Jomin (Paalin Kabaak). The trio then meet
        Panda (Deepak Dobriyal), who also helps Bhaskar in his mission.
        He gets bitten by a wolf, and begins to transform into the creature. As Bhaskar and his buddies try to find answers, a bunch of twists, turns, and laughs ensue.
